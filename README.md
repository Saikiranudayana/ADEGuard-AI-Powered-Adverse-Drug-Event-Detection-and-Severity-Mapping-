# Adverse Drug Event Detection System

This project implements an advanced Natural Language Processing system for detecting, classifying, and analyzing Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from medical text. It uses state-of-the-art deep learning models and machine learning techniques to extract entities, classify severity, cluster symptoms, and provide model explanations.

## Features

- **ADE Entity Extraction**: Identifies drugs, symptoms, severity indicators, and other medical entities in text using BioBERT
- **Severity Classification**: Automatically categorizes adverse events as mild, moderate, or severe
- **Symptom Clustering**: Groups similar symptoms to identify patterns using HDBSCAN and Sentence-BERT
- **Explainable AI**: Provides insight into model decisions using LIME/SHAP

- Required packages listed in requirements.txt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash

### Data Preparation

To prepare training data from raw medical texts:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_training_data.py --input data/raw_data.csv --output data/processed/
```

This script will:
- Clean and preprocess the text
- Create annotation tasks for Label Studio
- Generate preliminary severity labels
- Extract symptoms for clustering

### Training Models

To train the ADE models:

```bash
python scripts/train_and_evaluate.py --ner-annotations data/processed/label_studio_annotations.json --severity-file data/processed/severity_data.csv --symptoms-file data/processed/symptoms.csv --model-dir models/
```

This script will:
- Train the entity extraction model
- Train the severity classification model
- Perform symptom clustering
- Generate and evaluate model explanations

### Running Inference

To analyze text for ADEs:

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --text "Patient experienced severe headache after taking aspirin." --model-dir models/ --output results.json
```

For batch processing:

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --file data/test_cases.txt --model-dir models/ --output batch_results.json
```

1. Gender Distribution (Pie Chart)

- Majority of reports are from Females (62.7%).

- Males contribute 32.5%, while Unknown gender accounts for 4.8%.

- This indicates a strong skew toward female-reported cases.

2. Age Distribution (Histogram)

- Reports are lowest in very young (0â€“9) and very old (100+).

- Peak reporting is observed between 50â€“69 years, especially in the 50â€“59 and 60â€“69 groups.

- Secondary peaks occur in 30â€“49 years, while reports decline after 70.

- Suggests middle-aged and elderly populations contribute the most reports.

3. Heatmap of Reports by Sex and Age Group

- Confirms patterns from above but adds gender detail.

- Females dominate across all age groups, especially between 30â€“69 years, with peak counts in 60â€“69 (241k) and 50â€“59 (233k).

- Males show maximum counts in the same range (60â€“69: 120k; 50â€“59: 98k) but consistently fewer than females.

- nUnknown category is minimal but more frequent in younger and middle-aged groups.

- Overall, the 60â€“69 female group is the highest reporting cluster.
